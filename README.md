# automate - WIP 
The goal of this project is to create a platform to connect networked devices together, especially microcontrollers.  Automate will eliminate the need to write custom boiler-plate configuration code, and to allow focus on the unique functionality of devices through a standard API and platform stack.

For developers:

For example, imagine having a light sensor and a motor, on two different microcontrollers or devices.  The light sensor only has functionality to tell brightness, and the motor actuates to close a door.   We will then be able to construct statements such as:  When it is dark, close the door.  At 10pm close the door after if is light for 10 minutes. etc.  No need to write networking code.  No need to write "business logic".
